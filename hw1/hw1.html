            <b>Q1</b>: Register to the class forum.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A1</b>: Finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q2</b>: Find out which category so-called "Chrome plug-in" technology belongs to.
        <p>
            <b>A2</b>: Distributed Object Technology.<br>
            Distributed Object Technology is the technique to allow objects distributed across difference spaces, 
            or different platforms, but they can work together by sharing data and invoking methods. Therefore, 
            you do not need to place the object on both the client and the server.<br>
            I consider Chrome plug-ins as a technique belonging to DOT because they are packed programs placed on 
            the client side. While the server may not be aware of what plug-in program the client insert into the 
            browser, the server can invoke it whenever the client needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q3</b>: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the stateless character? Can the server know 
            how many browsers are reading its documents?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A3</b>:<br>
            <b>Advantage</b>: (1) Simple. The server does not need to store each user's information in order to 
            communicate with them.<br>
            (2) Fault tolerance. User's request can be responsed by any available server, so even one server 
            stops the connection, there are still other servers that can response to the user without the 
            transmission of user information.<br>
            (3) HTTP is a stateless protocol itself. Developers don't need to simulate status for the connection 
            if they adopt the stateless mode.<br>
            <b>Disadvantage</b>: The user should send its information (cookies, for example) in each request. This 
            occupies the bandwidth of the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server cannot know how many browsers are accessing its document, because the stateless character
            means that other clients are able to imitate the current client's request, and since there is
            no client information and status on the server, the server cannot distinguish the "real" requests and 
            "fake" requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q4</b>: Why Java Applet is getting dead and Javascript succeeds?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A4</b>: Java Applet is Java programs which are embedding into the webpage. It requires JVM and Java
            interpreters on the server to compile and execute those programs before rendering the webpage, which is
            not in line with the REST style.
            In contrast, Javascript is an interpreted language which can be inserted directly into HTML scripts.
            This means that Javascript scipts can directly interact with HTML.
