A apache server is needed.
There are some Perl scripts under the directory ``script``. These scripts should be put in the ``cgi-bin`` directory under your apache root, or the correspoding ``ScriptAlias`` directory.
All the other scripts should be put under the ``DocumentRoot`` directory of your server.
